IGLSynth (Infinite Games on graph &amp; Logic-based controller Synthesis) is a high-level Python API for solving Infinite Games and Logic-based strategy Synthesis. It provides an easy interface to

1. Define two-player games-on-graphs.
2. Assign tasks to players using formal logic.
3. Write solvers to compute winning strategies in the game.


See [Documentation Page](akulkarni.me/iglsynth) for installation instructions and API documentation. 

**Note:** IGLSynth is still under development.
